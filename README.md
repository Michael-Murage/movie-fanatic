The project is for a theoretical movie fanatic that would need a way to get information about upcoming movies, search their favourite movies and also suggest movies that need a part two or even a movie idea they have. The project also has a custom pipe that translates some specific words (fast, family and rings) to swahili.

The project is written in Angular v16 and styled using tailwindcss.

To get started locally, install the required dependencies, I was using npm;

```
npm install
```

start the server
```
npm run start
```

and navigate to the URL on port <strong>4300</strong>

To run some of the tests configured, run

```
npm run test
```
